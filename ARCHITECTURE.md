This document provides a high-level overview of the structure, flow, and component interaction within the JoyaTech platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core System Flow

1. **User Access**: 
   - Users access the platform through the browser.
   - Static assets are served from the `public/` directory.

2. **Frontend Application**:
   - Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
   - Components are organized modularly under `/src/components`.
   - Pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Blog, Magazine, Contact) are routed via React Router.

3. **Data Management**:
   - Static JSON files in `/src/entities` are used to manage and display content for services, AI tools, blog posts, and magazine articles.
   - In future phases, this will transition to dynamic content powered by **Supabase**.

4. **State and Utilities**:
   - Contexts and custom hooks (to be developed) will manage global application states such as language switching (RTL/LTR support).

5. **Deployment**:
   - Initial deployment will be via **Firebase Hosting**.
   - Future enhancements include real-time integrations with **Supabase**.

6. **External Tools Integration**:
   - **Manus.im** will be used to automate repetitive processes and backend flows.
   - **Google Workspace** integration for content management and communication automation.
